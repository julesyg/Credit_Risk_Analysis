# CREDIT RISK ANALYSIS

Supervised Machine Learning.

## OVERVIEW OF LOAN PREDICTION LOAN ANALYSIS:

purpose of this analysis

## RESULTS:

Six machine learning models were used in this loan prediction analysis, the Balanced Accuracy Score, Precision and Recall for each model are as follows:

## Naive Random Oversampling
1. Balanced Accuracy Score: 0.6605547657197899

2. Precision: high risk loans = 0.01 (1%). low risk loans = 1.00 (100%)

3. Recall: high risk loans = 0.69 (69%). low risk loans = 0.63 (63%)

## SMOTE Oversampling
1. Balanced Accuracy Score: 0.6550858927099446

2. Precision: high risk loans = 0.01 (1%). low risk loans = 1.00 (100%)

3. Recall: high risk loans = 0.63 (63%). low risk loans = 0.39 (68%)

## Undersampling
1. Balanced Accuracy Score: 0.5439153831192286

2. Precision: 0.01 (1%). low risk loans = 1.00 (100%)

3. Recall: 0.69 (69%). low risk loans = 0.39 (63%)
